# intro-to-go

This is a slide deck for a talk "Intro to Go" I gave at [Codeable](https://codeable.pe/) at 27 May 2020 as part of my preparation to become a fullstack web developer. The talk and slides are in Spanish.

To view slides locally you should first install Go and setup GOPATH. Then install present command with `go get golang.org/x/tools/present`. Finally clone this repository (git clone git://github.com/kucho/intro-to-go.git), run present in cloned directory and open http://127.0.0.1:3999/ in your browser.
